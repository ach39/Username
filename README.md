##  Repo Overview
I'm Seasoned technologist in design, development and performance analytics of large-scale communication systems.
Besides Wireless Network, I had opportunity to flex my ML and User-research skills to solve several real-world problems from different industry domains.

o	Human Computer Interaction :  Created prototype for redesigned Ring Doorbell interface. Was awarded ‘Best Project’ for going above and beyond in recognizing and addressing social and ethical challenges current design poses.

o	Reinforcement learning : Developed Q-learning based agent that would learn an effective trading strategy for stocks using key technical indicators such as Slow Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Band%.

o	Big Data / NLP : Implemented analytic infrastructure to process 700M+ medical records and developed models to predict ‘Onset of Sepsis’ several hours before clinical diagnosis.

o	Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence :  Created an agent that used analogical and visual reasoning, emulating human cognition to solve IQ test (Raven’s Matrices), achieving score of 87% (52/60)

o	Neural Networks : Delivered a robust phishing detection system using Neural Network to protect online assets.
