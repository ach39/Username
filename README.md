##  Repo Overview
###### *I'm seasoned technologist in design, development and performance analytics of large-scale wireless communication systems. Outside work, I had opportunity to flex my ML and User-research skills to solve several real-world problems from different industry domains.*

o	[Human Computer Interaction](https://github.com/ach39/Human-Computer-Interaction) :  Created prototype for redesigned Ring Doorbell interface. Was awarded ‘Best Project’ for going above and beyond in recognizing and addressing social and ethical challenges current design poses.

o	[Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ach39/Machine-Learning-for-Trading): Developed Q-learning based agent that would learn an effective trading strategy for stocks using key technical indicators such as Slow Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Band%.

o	[Big Data / NLP](https://github.com/ach39/Big-Data/tree/master/sepsis_prediction) : Implemented analytic infrastructure to process 700M+ medical records and developed models to predict ‘Onset of Sepsis’ several hours before clinical diagnosis.

o	[Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/ach39/KnowledgeBased-AI) :  Created an agent that used analogical and visual reasoning, emulating human cognition to solve IQ test (Raven’s Matrices), achieving score of 87% (52/60)

o	[Neural Networks](https://github.com/ach39/Machine-Learning) : Delivered a robust phishing detection system using Neural Network to protect online assets.
